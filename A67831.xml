            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In fine, it is that door of Hell which opens to all the diſaſtrous miſeries of mankind; it is that hand which directed and plunged the Knife of <hi>Cain</hi> into the throat of his Brother
<pb facs="tcp:34927:7"/>
               <hi>Abel;</hi> it nearly reſembles thoſe Birds of blood and prey, which live in the unfortunate Iſlands near the North-Pole, and devour one another even in their Neſts. Ambition carries conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in its hand Glaſſes of a thouſand Faces, and coloured with as many Paſſions; which cauſeth Fire frequently to be taken for Smoak, Black for White, and all Beauties for Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities or Deceits.</p>
            <p>Let us look about us, and ſee it aptly decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher'd in the preſent State of <hi>Europe,</hi> which has ſufficiently felt the diſmal conſequences thereof, in the miſerable effects of unnatural and bloody Wars: Which moſt influencing and malignant Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>There is certainly now no Heaven upon Earth; the Devil is broke looſe, and that Maſter of Miſ-rule has ſet the World together by the ears; his Engines are now abroad, his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks onely practiſed, his <hi>Machiavil</hi> is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Redivivus,</hi> and his Diſciples preach the enſuing Doctrines. Nothing that's Sacred, can binde Mankinde to its good behaviour,
<pb facs="tcp:34927:7"/>the Decalogue, and all ſacred Ordinances, ar<hi rend="sup">e</hi> but weak Reſtrictions where Ambition holds the Plow, and Faction or Self-intereſt drives it. Hence ſpring the general Calamities of all Nations; and the two great Enemies that now ſeem principally to threaten <hi>Europe,</hi> are, either Ambition abroad, or Faction at home.<note place="margin">Forreign Ambition, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As for the firſt; Do we not ſee how frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are the Pretenſions of <hi>France?</hi> With what violence he has carried on a War, and with what injuſtice; how all <hi>Europe</hi> burns and conſumes by the Flames he kindled and begun? Can we not ſee that his Ambition has out-ſtretcht a greater diſtance than betwixt <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice?</hi> Or do we imagine our Strength and<note n="*" place="margin">See the Character of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Heylyn</hi>'s deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Italy, parag.</hi> 38. <hi>ſol.</hi> 57.</note> Courage to be greater and more formidable than the Emperour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Princes? Or have we ſo mean thoughts, as to think his Majeſties Dominions not worth his pains? Or is the French King's love ſo great (and that entailed on the Crown he wears) that he will not hurt us? Can we be ſecure in Fools Paradiſe? Safety lies not in Imagination, but in Judgment: And the tyranny of that Prince is ſuch (prompted by his Ambition) as will admit of no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that ſhall be ſafe either for us or others. His Ambition is that Soil on which nothing can grow, to advance the intereſt of another: He hates all Superiours or Equals; and with
<pb facs="tcp:34927:8"/>reſtleſs pains and Labour covets and purſues u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly,<note place="margin">Faction.</note> Let the State beware of that Bufie-body, Faction at home; an enemy of a more horrendous ſhape than Ambition; the int<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being but as the Stirrup by which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mounts into the Saddle of Rebellion.</p>

It exclaims againſt Popery as the Whore of Babylon, when it aims only to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Epiſcopacy; and if Monarchy ſtands in the way, the Diadem ſhall be deſtroyed with the Mitre. In fine, it makes the deepeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on popular eaſineſs; and by ſounding in the ears of the unwary people the pleaſing clangors of Liberty!

               </gap>re I found nothing but milde and ſoft Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; I enquired into the breathings of the Spirit, and they were pacificatory; I wondered from what Preſidents and Scripture-encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments theſe men deduced their practices, and at laſt was forced to conclude, that they were onely pretended Chaplains to the Prince of Peace: Thoſe Tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb facs="tcp:34927:9"/>
            <p>My deſigne in this is onely to detect the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks of wicked men, to expoſe their Principles to every mans view: This is that Key that muſt open and at once expoſe the cancered breaſts of evil Miniſters: 'Tis this that will dilate the cloſe deſigns of Tyrants; and if duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, both opens to the view of all, and for ever ſhuts the back-doors and by-ways to Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur: This is for bringing all above-board, and playing fair: This will inſtruct us how to prevent the dangerous conſequences of Ambition abroad, and Faction at home: This will put us on our guard againſt the deſignes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Surprizals of <hi>France:</hi> This will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of <hi>Forty One,</hi> and if well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, will undeceive many true Proteſtants, whoſe judgment now as well as then have been hood-winked and perverted (much againſt their own diſpoſitions and Loyalty) by the falſe News and Impoſtures of the Jeſuits and Faraticks, into evil conceits, deſtructive in their conſequence both to themſelves and lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, in the ruine of their Lives, Religion, and Liberty. And I dare appeal to many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Gentlemen, If they have not too lately found themſelves by ſuch means deceived? I need not mention ſuch who have been too lately drawn in by the Faction, and have ſince prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And to let you ſee that our Fanaticks, even of theſe times, are of the ſame Stamp with thoſe of <hi>Forty One,</hi> read but the two Speeches of <hi>John King</hi> and <hi>John Kid,</hi> Miniſters;<note place="margin">Executed at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Aug.</hi> 14.1679.</note> where, in the very hour of death, they both bear teſtimony to the Solemn League and Covenant, and againſt Antichriſtian <hi>Prelacy,</hi> as a thing that calls for divine Vengeance; and in their judgments declare, They thought their Riſing in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be no <hi>Rebellion,</hi> becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſupport the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> How many hundred inſtances are there to be offered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have openly expreſſed their implacable Malice and Hatred to the preſent eſtabliſhe and Liberty. And I dare appeal to many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Religion and Government?</p>
            <p>But before we proceed, it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to over-rule the Presbyterian's Plea of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence in all matters of Blood and Cruelty: <hi>The Lord knows</hi> (ſays he) who is the ſearcher of hearts,<note place="margin">King's Sp. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> that neither my deſigne nor practice was againſt his Majeſties Perſon and <hi>juſt Government,</hi> but always ſtudied to be loyal to<note n="*" place="margin">They count no Authority lawful in the Lord, but what allows them Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertty.</note> 
               <hi>lawful Authority</hi> in the Lord. Which are the very dying-words of Mr. <hi>King,</hi> having in the words immediately foregoing, juſtified the Rebellion as neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of his poor afflicted Brethren: Therefore it was, ſaid he, <hi>that I joyned with that poor Handful,</hi> meaning the Rebels.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:34927:10"/>
            <p>The Presbyterians were not concerned in the Murder of our late martyr'd Soveraign! No, not they! But let us ſee what the Independent tells them (who was joyntly concerned in that Rebellion with them) going about to convince them of the danger of this King's Reſtauration. Conſider (ſays our Author) the animoſity naturally inherent in the Royal Party and their Head againſt you;<note place="margin">Fol. 12, 13.</note> they will never leave buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing in his ears, that the intereſt of your Party was in its infancy founded in <hi>Scotland</hi> upon the ruine of his great Grandmother, continued and improved by the perpetual vexation of his Grandfather, and at length proſecuted to the Decapitating of his Father. Be not ſo weak as to ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th your ſelves, that you ſhall fare better than others, becauſe you never oppoſed this young Gentlemans perſon; it is ground ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his hatred, that you bandied againſt his Father, and the Prerogative to which be conceives himſelf Heir. It is the common ſenſe of the Cavaliers, that you prepared his Father for the Block, and are incenſed at others, becauſe they took from you the honor of the Execution. And in a Faſt-Sermon preached upon the news of his death, before his Son then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> Dr. <hi>Creighton</hi> told him, That the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians pulled his Father down and held him by the hair, while the Independents cut off his head.

In ſhort, you brought him (as it were) to the foot of the Scaffold, whoever led him up.

            <p>Here is a Charge fairly drawn up by one of their fellow-Labourers, who becauſe they joyned in the Murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, doth from thence endeavour to perſwade them to keep out King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, leſt they ſhould be brought to Juſtice. That they have acted heretofore even in this very manner, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny; but I hope they will have more grace or leſs power for the future, and let their Loyalty and Allegiance be as e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>inent for the time to come, as their Inſurrections and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions have been notorious in times paſt: But I muſt ſuſpend my Faith in theſe matters, and cannot believe they are come to this paſs, till I hear of no tumultuous Petitions or Aſſociations, till I meet with no<note n="*" place="margin">A dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> Appeals, and other ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pamphlets and Libels. To rebearſe even theſe matters, may ſeem ſomewhat harſh; but to ſee them repeated by that Party, would be much more terrible. I know the old Rule, which ſaith, <hi>That Truth is not to be ſpoken at all times,</hi> doth not deny but that there is a time for mourning as well as laughing, and ſeems to intimate, that the ſevereſt Truths may be told at proper ſeaſons. That we may tell his preſent Majeſty what his Royal Father ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, when the ſame Engines are at work for his deſtruction, is ſurely no Crime, but an act of Loyalty, a ſeaſonable Memorial, and a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent upon every Subject.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:34927:11"/>
            <p>This Treatiſe deſignes not to derogate from the true eſteem and dignity of any ſober, honeſt, and judicious Polititian: Wholſome and good Policy is not to be expoſed to irreverence, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to every vulgar judgment; that Science is ever built upon Piety and Prudence: On theſe foundations the wiſe and honeſt Stateſman makes it his endeavours to raiſe the glorious Superſtructure of a well-eſtabliſht government in a Prince, which will effect the moſt willing Obedience in the People; by which the intereſts of both are ſo mutually interwoven, that the good or bad fortune of the one, cannot occur without the neceſſary conſent or means of both together: That the Prerogatives of the Crown may ſhine forth and be preſerved in their due luſtre, and the Subjects Liberties reſt without Injury or Violation.</p>
            <p>That Stateſman is not unaptly ſtiled the Atlas of the ſinking State, which hath Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt every Maladie, heals it when ſick, eaſeth it when oppreſt, and meets it in its ſeveral preſſures with ſuitable reliefs. Such was <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> of whom one ſaid it was a meaſuring caſt, Whether <hi>Lewis</hi> was the wiſer King, or <hi>Philip</hi> the wiſer Counſeller. Such was <hi>Butleigh</hi> to our late Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> whoſe Counſels moſt effectually produced, or contributed to the proſperity of that Queens
<pb facs="tcp:34927:12"/>Reign, which was ſo eminent, as I believe few Ages can parallel; and Poſterity ſhall read her happy Annals like <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s Remarks on his <hi>Cyrus, Non ad hiſtoriae fidem, ſed ad exemplum juſti imperii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Facticus and ambitious Spirits (that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take their meaſures of what is juſt and right, by the probability onely, and not by the honeſty of the means) have too frequently ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied the Glory of this noble Science by impious Gloſſes (like the common Blaſphemers of the moſt divine Oracles) and by wreſting the true deſignes thereof to contrary and wicked ends, have made it truckle under the Slavery of their helliſh actions, according to the emergency of their own occaſions; like the Laws that were made in <hi>Cauſinus</hi> his <hi>Babel,</hi> to be ruled by Manners, and not Manners by Laws. Theſe are the men that can vex true Policy by tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and falſe gloſſing; they erect in their hearts <hi>Diana's</hi> of Hypocriſie, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways adore and worſhip in the ſubtilty of their actions.</p>
            <p>The following Principles, there are few ſo ſilly as to make them the Articles of their Creed, tho' too many now-a-days ſo wicked as to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and not only ſo but by a daring impudence, to perſwade and juſtifie the wickedneſs of their actions by the goodneſs and neceſſity of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:34927:12"/>Principles. Theſe men raiſe the billows of the Commonwealth; theſe turn all calm Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renities into bluſtering Storms and Tempeſts: Where theſe Monſters come, there's nothing but lamentable Outcries, occaſioned by Rapes, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, and Murders.

               <p>Secondly, he muſt compoſe his very garb and geſture: 'Tis an excellent gift, to tell a lye with a boon grace.

Then! then our State-Chymiſt hath brought the Elixir of his Machinations to perfection: He may now apply his ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Remedies to the feeble State, and work upon the peoples weakneſs what projects he pleaſe; but muſt always take heed that

                  <p>It is a general concluſion, that no man loves to be deceived; and I think (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) fewer to be undeceived. It has been a Task extreamly difficult (even next to an impoſſibility) to convince ſome men of the iniquity of our Late Times; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when I have urged the horrid impiety of murdering the late King, (and the wickedneſs of thoſe that uſurped the Government after him, expreſſed in the moſt arbitrary Cruelties on the perſons and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34927:28"/>eſtates of his Majeſties Friends and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) they have ſo far allowed that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fact, and concluded with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, as to charge the Royal Martyr with being guilty of ſome faults; or elſe have paſt thoſe matters over wholly in ſilence: and ſuch memoirs have ſerved them onely to revive their ancient malice againſt the preſent Government; and inſtead of a ſincere Repentance to avert the heavie Judgments of the Almighty for thoſe cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins, they have uſually replied, That truly they do not know whether <hi>Oliver</hi> were a Rogue or not; but this they were ſure of, that they had much better times then than now; Drunkenneſs was not ſo much encouraged, and Whoredom was out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; Trading was much better, and they did not pay ſo many Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if all this were true (which we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, becauſe we know the contrary) will it one jot extenuate the guilt of ſuch who ſhall go about, either directly or indirectly, to approve and juſtifie the prodigious Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies of thoſe cruel Uſurpers? No; let ſuch men know, that an Act of Mercy and prudent Oblivion in the State, will rather aggravate than obliterate their monſtrous Crimes in the Court of Heaven.

We are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo ſhort ſighted, that we cannot ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Time; we value things and men by their temporal felicities; whereas if we put Eternity into the other Scale, it will much out-poiſe that worldly luſtie that ſo

The ſmootheſt Waters are for the moſt part deep and dangerous; and the goodlieſt Bloſſoms nipt by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly Froſt, either periſh, or produce their Fruit ſowre or unwholſome; which may properly imply, That the viſible Kalendar is not always the true character of inward perfection.

Chriſt's Kingdom was not, our Happineſs is not, of this world. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, he were of all men moſt miſerable, if his expectations were in this life. Nor indeed doth my Bible ſhew me any warrant for appeal to Heaven, for the deciſion of this or that intricacy, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing Succeſs upon this Party or that Cauſe, according to its righteouſneſs.

And again, he can aſſume whiteneſs; for I often finde him wearing the Vail of Innocence to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the horrid deformity and blackneſs of all his actions. If Religion be in vogue, you can ſcarce diſtinguiſh him from a Saint; he doth not onely reſpect and reverence the holy Miniſters, but if occaſion ſerve, he can preach himſelf; and if he fail in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, he can nevertheleſs (never heeding Blaſphemy) perſwade the Rabble that his Whining Cant and Babbling is truely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Holy, as proceeding immediately by Inſpiration from the Holy Ghoſt.
